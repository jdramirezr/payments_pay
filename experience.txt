Experience with this Technical Assessment:

    • Tokenization: Is the process of obtaining an element (string), and this element is the representation of confidential and sensitive data, it is used to make processes and requests to the servers safely.
    • Authorize: It is the process that authorizes the order to transfer the funds in a next step, authorizes so that a provider can make the transaction.
    • capture: it is the process that, after authorization, transfers the funds, this process has a specific time and this time is according to the need of the providers.
    • charge: This process combines authorization and loading in one step, funds are transferred once the customer has made the payment without waiting time.
    • void: When a payment is authorized and you are waiting for the capture, the operation to cancel this future transaction is void, which allows you to remove the authorization to stop the payment process.
    • refund: After loading or capturing depending on the payment flow, once the transaction is completed, a refund allows you to undo this process and return the amount charged to the customer.


Experience:

    • The documentation has an error with the name of the variables app-id and private-key really the name is app_id and private_key.
    • The token that is generated by the function createToken(additionalData, callback) return a string which should be an object.
    • In general I think that paymentsos is a good library, easy to integrate,it has a great  variety of providers and it is sage to make payment processes
